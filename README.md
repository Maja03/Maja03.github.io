# <b>HOW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AFFECT AMERICAN FOOTBALL</b>
## <b>DIGITA HEALTH IN AMERICAN FOOTBLL</b> 
New helmets, data-gathering sensors, and a turf testing machine called the BEAST are making the game safer for the NFL (National Football League) players. NFL and its partners for example: Amazon Web Service (AWS) are collecting more data. By analyzing the data, conclusions can be drawn about the causes of various injuries, thus preventing them and keeping players safer.
#### PROJECT:
- [Helmet Testing](#HELMET-TESTING)
- [HeadHealthTECH Challenges & the NFL Helmet Challenge](#HEADHEAL-THTECH-CHALLANGES-&-THE-NFL-HELMET-CHALLENGE)
- [The BEAST](#THE-BEAST)
- [The Digital Athletes](#THE-DIGITAL-ATHLETES)
- [Data Collecting](#DATA-COLLECTING) 
- Ruel Challenges â€“ NFL has used data to inform more than 50 rules changes to eliminate potentially dangerous tackles and reduce the risk of injury.
## <b>HELMET TESTING</b>
Each season, NFL players select a new helmet from the helmet safety list. Better performance helmets have contributed to a sustained reduction of concussions by 25% in each of the last four seasons. Last season, the number of concussions was at an all-time low. The League's work on innovative helmets doesn't stop there. In the pursuit of safer protective equipment for players, the NFL hosts innovative challenges, including the NFL Helmet Challenge. The NFL is also helping to drive the development of position-adjusted helmets and advances in customized helmets using technology such as 3D printing to continue to advance helmet safety and innovation.

#### CRASH CLOUD TECHNOLOGY 
Springs put together a team of engineers to design Windpact's Crash Cloud technology, a liner system that has the arrow protected from being shot at different speeds and angles.The patented Windpact Crash Cloud both absorbs energy as it compresses, and dissipates energy through impact vents, before rapidly re-inflating like a spring. The most important thing about Crash Cloud is the foam. Crash Cloud can intelligently adapt to the level of the strike and solve a wide range of strikes, from linear strikes to rotational strikes. The unique combination of controlled airflow and lightweight open-cell foams reduces weight and size. Creates an energy absorption system that provides excellent impact protection without restriction. it is modular and can take any shape, size or texture depending on the application.
