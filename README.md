## <b>DIGITA HEALTH IN AMERICAN FOOTBLL</b> 
New helmets, data-gathering sensors, and a turf testing machine called the BEAST are making the game safer for the NFL (National Football League) players. NFL and its partners for example: Amazon Web Service (AWS) are collecting more data. By analyzing the data, conclusions can be drawn about the causes of various injuries, thus preventing them and keeping players safer.
#### PROJECT:
- [Helmet Testing](#HELMET-TESTING)
- [HeadHealthTECH Challenges & the NFL Helmet Challenge](#HEADHEAL-THTECH-CHALLANGES-&-THE-NFL-HELMET-CHALLENGE)
- [The BEAST](#THE-BEAST)
- [The Digital Athletes](#THE-DIGITAL-ATHLETES)
- [Data Collecting](#DATA-COLLECTING) 
- Ruel Challenges â€“ NFL has used data to inform more than 50 rules changes to eliminate potentially dangerous tackles and reduce the risk of injury.
## <b>HELMET TESTING</b>
Each season, NFL players select a new helmet from the helmet safety list. Better performance helmets have contributed to a sustained reduction of concussions by 25% in each of the last four seasons. Last season, the number of concussions was at an all-time low. The League's work on innovative helmets doesn't stop there. In the pursuit of safer protective equipment for players, the NFL hosts innovative challenges, including the NFL Helmet Challenge. The NFL is also helping to drive the development of position-adjusted helmets and advances in customized helmets using technology such as 3D printing to continue to advance helmet safety and innovation.

#### CRASH CLOUD TECHNOLOGY 
Springs put together a team of engineers to design Windpact's Crash Cloud technology, a liner system that has the arrow protected from being shot at different speeds and angles.The patented Windpact Crash Cloud both absorbs energy as it compresses, and dissipates energy through impact vents, before rapidly re-inflating like a spring. The most important thing about Crash Cloud is the foam. Crash Cloud can intelligently adapt to the level of the strike and solve a wide range of strikes, from linear strikes to rotational strikes. The unique combination of controlled airflow and lightweight open-cell foams reduces weight and size. Creates an energy absorption system that provides excellent impact protection without restriction. it is modular and can take any shape, size or texture depending on the application.

## <b>HEADHEAL THTECH CHALLANGES & THE NFL HELMET CHALLENGE</b>
#### HEADHEALTHTECH CHALLENGES
Made by the National Football League (NFL) and Football Research, Inc. (FRI) have partnered with Duke University's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Duke CTSI). The aim is to deepen and improve the quality in e.g. in the assessment of head protection, material science and kinematic measurements. That's why the HeadHealthTECH Challenge series is part of the Engineering Roadmap, and the goal is to better understand the biomechanics of the head during injuries in American football. It is also an incentive for small enterprises, universities to try to create better, more modern protective equipment. NFL and FRI will give $ 1,6mln grant to help with development 13 new technology. 
#### NFL HELMET CHALLENGES
NFL Helmet Challenges has the task, based on specific laboratory tests, to create a new helmet for NFL players that will be better than those currently in use. NFL and Football Research, Inc. (FRI) awarded a $1.37 million HeadHealthTECH grant to four teams of innovators to support the creation of their helmet prototypes to be entered into the ongoing NFL Helmet Challenge. The challenge is to create a helmet based on laboratory tests that will be better than the one used so far. 
The judging panel combines expertise in engineering, biomechanics, neuroscience, sports business, and includes two NFL legends and an NFL equipment manager.

In addition to the visual assessment, the cash register will also undergo laboratory tests to check whether it meets the Helmet Performance Score (HPS) requirements. Lab testing conditions are designed to represent potentially concussive head strikes in the NFL, and this is the same process used annually to rank helmets by performance to inform players and club medical, training, coaching and equipment personnel about the best helmets on the market today.
